# NLP Strategy Overview
Predicting returns from 8K documents using text analysis and natural language processing.

## Results
Let's show the most interesting part first, the results.

| dimensionality redudction    | classifier             | f1_weighted |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| LatentDirichletAllocation    | RandomForestClassifier | 0.337532    |
|                              | SGDClassifier          | 0.404128    |
| TruncatedSVD                 | RandomForestClassifier | 0.333562    |
|                              | SGDClassifier          | 0.405563    |

## Setup
This setup assumes you already have `conda` and `git` installed.
1. Clone this repo at your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/hatemr/NLP-for-8K-documents.git`
2. Create the conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate ey-nlp`

## Data Preparation
1. Download 8K documents from today's S&P 500 companies for the past 5 years.
2. Extract the useful text from the html documents.
3. Clean text: 
    * From `/ey-nlp` run `python ey_nlp/preprocessing.py`. This creates a copy.
    * remove proper nouns (Apple), make lower case (The -> the), expand contractions (can't -> cannot), remove special characters and digits ('[^a-zA-z0-9\s]'), remove stopwords (a, the), remove html tags (`<p></p>`), remove accented characters, remove newlines ([\r|\n|\r\n]+), remove extra whitespace
4. Tokenize text:
    * lemmatize, stemmer
5. Vectorize to a document-term matrix using `CountVectorizer`.
    * All our models require creating the document-term matrix. However, we 
  might later try models that use another vectorizer (e.g. tf-idf).

## Data Splitting
  
| dataset       | dates             | n_samples     | indices     |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| train         | 1/2/15 - 7/31/17  | 9947 (52%)    | 0:9947      |
| validate      | 7/31/17 - 8/31/18 | 4852 (25%)    | 9947:14799  |
| test          | 9/1/18 - 10/25/19 | 4284 (23%)    | 14799:19083 |
| total         | 1/2/15 - 10/25/19 | 19083 (100%)  | 0:19083     |
  
## Modeling
Our strategy varies along a few dimensions.

1. __Document-term matrix__: CountVectorizer, tf-idf
2. __Dimensionality reduction__: PCA, LDA, HLDA, SESTM [(Ke et. al. 2019)](references/Predicting_Returns_with_Text_Data.pdf)
3. __Horizon__: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30
4. __Model__: logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting

## Scoring metric: f1_weighted
We use the scoring metric `f1_weighted` from `sklearn` on the validation set for 
model selection. `f1_weighted` computes
the f1 score for each class of the target variable, then takes the weighted 
mean over classes. The weight is the number of true instances of the class. This
helps account for class imbalance by giving greater weight to higher-frequency
classes.

One idea is to change the scoring metric to our own PnL calculation. However,
we seek to compare different NLP techniques with each other, not create a 
realistic investment stategy. Therefore, we stick with _f1_weighted_.

### LDA for Topic Modeling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) aims to model documents as arising from multiple topics, where a _topic_ is defined to be a distribution over a fixed vocabulary of terms. Each document exhibits these topics with different proportions. The K topics and their relative weights are treated as hidden variables. Given a collection of documents, the _posterior distribution_ of the hidden variables given the observed documents determines a hidden topical decomposition of the collection.

### LDA Topic Explanations
We classify each 8-K documents into different topics based on its highest probability of the specific topic. We then screen the most common words appeared in each topic across these text information. By the similarity of the 8-K information, we concluded on giving a literal meaning of each topics as below.

Topic 1:    Topic2:    Topic3:    Topic4:    Topic5:    
Topic6: Board of director member change.  
Topic7: Vote result for shareholders and appointment of new public audit company.
Topic8: Amendment of agreement(all different agreement)
Topic9: Realease Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Topic10: Regulation FD disclosure and change in orginization structure

(Most of the topic sentiment is neutral.)
